月光之下=Under the Moonlight

为了买到一种特别的点心，{{A}}提出前往{{B}}。在回程的单轨列车上，意想不到的变故悄然降临。=<size\=26>In order to buy a special kind of pastry, {{A}} suggested going to {{B}}. On the way back aboard the monorail, an unexpected incident quietly unfolded.</size>

今天的课结束了……=Today's class is over...
r:"^啊，(.*)。\n可以打扰一下吗？$"="Ah, $1.\nCan I bother you for a moment?"
你今天有什么安排吗？\n没有的话……要不要和我一起出去？=Do you have any plans today? If not... would you like to go out with me?

很闲=I'm free
呵呵，那正好。=Hehe, perfect then.
你请客的话……=If you're treating...
当然了，毕竟是我邀请你的。\n不用担心这个。=Of course—after all, I'm the one who invited you. Don't worry about that.

肚子饿了=I'm hungry
没关系哦。办完事后，\n我原本就打算找地方吃点东西。=It's fine. After finishing my work, I was planning to find a place to eat anyway.

那吾等要去哪里？=Then, where shall we go?
去「{{A}}」。=To "{{A}}".
是在海湾区域填海造陆，形成的一座人工岛。\n可以坐轻轨过去哦。=It's an artificial island built from land reclamation in the bay area. We can take the monorail there.
哦，轻轨……！=Oh, monorail...!
我想去那边的购物中心，\n买一种傍晚才开售的点心……=I want to visit the shopping mall there—they sell these special sweets that only go on sale in the evening...
但我是第一次去，有点不太放心。\n所以想找个人陪我一起。=But it's my first time going, so I'm a little nervous. That's why I wanted someone to come with me...
谢谢你。\n那我们出发吧？=Thank you.\nShall we head off, then?
和{{A}}一起，\n前往{{B}}……=Headed to {{B}} with {{A}}...
……找到了，就是那家店。\n真是太好了，顺利过来了呢……=...Found it! That's the shop. Thank goodness,\nwe made it here without a hitch...
你等我一下，我去买。=Wait here for me—I'll go buy them.
……然后，麻烦餐后上一份这个，\n「{{A}}店限定芭菲」。=...And, could we please have this? The '{{A}} Exclusive Parfait'.
好的！=Right away!
不过，能买到我想要的点心真是太好了。\n之前就听说是限量供应的……=Still, I'm glad I managed to get the pastry I wanted... I heard it was limited-edition...

好吃吗？=Is it good?
嗯……\n应该很好吃。大概吧……=Hmm... it should be good. Probably...

还挺稀有=Pretty rare
嗯……\n是啊，似乎只有从傍晚才开始卖……=Mm... yeah, it seems like they only start selling it in the evening...

其实，我也没好好吃过这个点心。=Actually, I've never properly tried it myself.
啊，应该是吃过的，\n但我没什么印象了……=Ah no, I have had it before, but... I don't really remember...
这个点心，是我妈妈很喜欢的。=This dessert... it was something my mother loved.
之前爸爸是这么告诉我的。=That's what my father told me, at least.
因为只能在{{A}}买到，\n爸爸也很少有机会来买。=Since it's only sold here at {{A}}, he rarely got the chance to buy it.
听他这么说，我就想在妈妈墓前供奉一点。\n毕竟我这个时间有空。=Hearing him say that, I wanted to offer some at my mother's grave. After all, I have time today.

原来是这样……=So that's how it is...
她会很高兴的= She'd be very happy

嗯。=Yeah.
据说妈妈住院的时候，只要医生同意，\n好像会经常吃这个呢。=They say when Mom was hospitalized, she would often eat this as long as the doctor allowed.
妈妈住院之前，好像也喂我吃过，\n但我没什么印象了。=And before her hospitalization... I think she even fed me some once, though I barely remember.
听说之后我有点好奇，还给自己也买了一份。\n下次大家一起吃吧？=After hearing that, I got curious and bought a portion for myself too. Let's eat it together next time?
嗯！吾也很想知道那是什么味道。=Mm! I too wish to know what flavor it holds.

要通知大家吗？=<size\=25>Should we let everyone know?</size>
发张照片吧=Let's take a picture

嗯，好。\n明天放学后，找个地方一起吃吧。=Yeah, sounds good. Let's find somewhere to eat together after school tomorrow.
在学校里的话，{{A}}不太方便过来吧。=If we're at school, it might be difficult for Shoki to join us.

去我家？=Go to my house?

去{{A}}？=Go to {{A}}?

谢谢。\n那就照你说的办。=Thanks. Let's do as you said, then.

-CALL START-
各位\n明天有空吗？=Are you all free tomorrow?
我买了点心，\n想和大家一起吃=I bought some sweets—thought we could enjoy them together
欸！可以吗！\n我超有空的！！=Eh! Really? I'm totally free!!
是什么点心呀？=What kind of sweets are they?
是我母亲喜欢的和式点心=They're traditional Japanese sweets my mother loved
只有在{{A}}\n才能买到哦=You can only get them at {{A}}
r:"^我和(.*)\n一起来买了$"="$1 came with me to buy them"
啊\n是在购物中心那里吗！？=Ah, from that shopping mall, right!?

没错=That's right
你知道吗？=You know about it?

嗯\n以前经常去=Yeah, I used to go there a lot
我也有空=I'm free too
我也能来哦=I can come as well
r:"^太好了\n那放学后\n就去(.*)家吧$"="Great. Then let's meet at $1's place after school"
收到！=Roger that!
Bene!
不过\n{{A}}啊=Speaking of {{A}}
我以前\n也去那里\n买过东西=I used to shop there too, back then
是吗\n那里有很多店吧=Oh? Heard it's got tons of shops
也有拉面店哦！\n应该是\n{{A}}会喜欢的那种=There's also a ramen shop! I think it's the kind {{A}} would like
真的吗！=For real!?
啊 好像不在购物中心\n是在商店街\n可以乘轻轨过去！=Ah, though it's not in the shopping mall—it's in the market district! You can take the monorail there!
r:"^下次去看看\n(.*)\n一起去吧$"="Let's check it out next time! $1, you're coming too"

去=Go

你请客=Your treat

真拿你没办法……=It can't be helped...

好嘞\n就这么说定了=Alright, it's settled
那{{A}}\n明天见啦！=See you tomorrow, {{A}}!

-CALL ENDED-

……拉面啊，\n我也有点感兴趣呢。=...Ramen, huh? I'm kinda interested too.
{{A}}也彻底喜欢上拉面了啊……=So even {{A}}'s fallen for ramen now...
倒不是什么拉面都喜欢啦。\n而且这也多亏了{{A}}他们。=Not just any ramen. And it's all thanks to Shun and the others.
不过，那家拉面店在哪里？在购物中心没看到呢……=But where is that ramen shop? I didn't see it at the shopping mall...
也是，我们搜一下吧。\n嗯……这一带的「拉面店」……=You're right, let's search for it. Hmm... 'ramen shops' in this area...
……嗯，范围太广了。\n搜出来好多店。=...Too broad. There are way too many results.
要找到{{A}}说的那家，可以说是大海捞针。\n……明天直接问她吧。=Finding {{A}}'s specific shop would be like searching for a needle in a haystack. ...Let's just ask her tomorrow.
这里虽然是个人工岛，\n但面积还挺大呢。=Even though this is an artificial island, it's actually pretty big
一听到人工岛，\n会感觉这里非常「新」，对吧？=When you hear 'artificial island', you'd expect everything to feel 'modern', right?
但实际上这有不少老房子和老店呢。\n刚才那家点心店就是。=But actually there are quite a few old houses and shops here. Like that pastry shop earlier.
不过这里的商业设施似乎也很多，\n所以也不会有古色古香的感觉。=Though with all these commercial facilities too, it doesn't exactly feel traditional.

还有轻轨呢=<size\=30>There's also the monorail</size>
是啊。不知怎么，\n轻轨总会给人很新的印象……=Yeah. For some reason, the monorail always feels so modern...

还有购物中心呢=<size\=24>There's also the shopping mall</size>
是呀。感觉除了我们，\n还有很多其他放学回家的高中生。=Yeah. Looks like there were a lot of other high school students heading home from school too.

这个家庭餐厅也是连锁店呢。=This family restaurant is a chain too.
让您久等啦。\n这是本店的限定芭菲。=Thank you for waiting! Here's our exclusive parfait.
谢谢。=Thank you.
一份还挺大的……\n{{A}}，你吃得完吗？=It's pretty big... {{A}}, can you finish this?
应该点迷你芭菲的……=Should've ordered the mini parfait...
和{{A}}分着吃完了芭菲……=Shared the parfait with {{A}}...

已经这么晚了啊……=It's already this late...

都怪{{A}}=Blame {{A}}
这、这也没办法呀！\n那个芭菲分量太大了……！=Th-That couldn't be helped! That parfait was enormous...!

不好意思=My bad
啊，我没有怪你的意思。\n别在意。=Ah, I didn't mean to blame you. Don't worry about it.

感谢您的乘坐。\n本次列车开往「{{A}}」……=Thank you for riding. This monorail is headed for Iwatodai Station...

啊……对了。难得有好吃的点心，\n明天我再带点茶过去吧。=Ah... right. Since we have these nice pastries, I'll bring some tea tomorrow too.
我会挑几种合适的。=I'll pick out a few that go well with it

那就拜托你了=I'll leave it to you then
谢谢=Thanks

没关系啦，是我提出来的。\n而且，点心要好好品尝才……=No problem, it was my idea anyway. Besides, sweets should be properly savored with...
呀！？=Kyah!?
怎么回事？=What's going on?
呃，车怎么停了……=Huh? Why'd we stop...?
难道出事故了……！？\n太倒霉了吧～……=An accident!? Ugh, just my luck...
你没事吧？=Are you alright?
没、没事……\n不过，这刹车也太突然了。=I-I'm fine... but that was such a sudden brake.
本次列车已紧急停车。\n刚刚接到消息，前方道岔发生故障。=This monorail has made an emergency stop. We've received reports of switch failure ahead.
修复工作预计需要些时间。\n给您带来不便非常抱歉，请在车内稍作等待。=Repairs will require some time. We apologize for the inconvenience - please wait calmly inside the monorail.
外面危险，请不要下车。\n重复一遍广播通知……=For your safety, do not exit the monorail. Repeating this announcement...
……这下麻烦了呢。=...This is troublesome.
说是需要一些时间……\n可再这样下去，末班车都要没了。=They said it'll take time... At this rate, we'll miss the last train.
要不要让车来接我们呢？\n等能下车了，就送你回{{A}}。= Should we call the car? Once we're allowed off, I'll have them take you back to {{A}}.

谢谢你=Thank you
没事的。\n毕竟是事故，也没办法。=It's alright. Accidents happen—there's nothing we can do.

那{{A}}呢？=What about you?
我也会直接坐车回家，不用担心。=I’ll head straight home by car too, so don’t worry

虽然这么说，\n也不知道什么时候才能下车……=That said, we still don't know when we'll be able to get off...
如果能再往前开一站就好了。\n再等一会儿吧。=If only we could make it to the next station. Let's wait a bit longer
在列车开动之前稍作等待……=Waited for a bit before the monorail started moving again...

太好了，总算是动起来了，\n但马上就要0点了呢……=Thank goodness, we're finally moving—but it's almost midnight...
搞得这么晚，真对不起……=I'm really sorry it got so late.

这不是{{A}}的错=It's not your fault
这也是没办法的事=Nothing we could do

……话是这么说啦。=...I know, but still
今日，由于道岔故障，\n列车时刻表大幅混乱……=Today, due to a track switch malfunction, the schedule has been severely disrupted...
给赶时间的乘客带来极大不便，\n非常抱歉。=We deeply apologize to all passengers for the inconvenience.
下一站～{{A}}～……=Next stop—Iwatodai...
下车吧。我已经叫了人来「{{A}}」。\n应该会有人来接我们。=Let's get off. I've already called someone to 'Iwatodai'. Someone should be coming to pick us up
啊～坐太久了，腰都僵了……=Ugh...I've been sitting so long, my back's all stiff..
虽然有点浪费，不过还是打车吧……=It's a bit wasteful, but guess I'm taking a taxi...
我先去看看接我们的车来没来。=I'll go check if the car picking us up is here.

马上就0点了……=It's almost midnight...
通过了检票口……=Passed through the ticket gate...
