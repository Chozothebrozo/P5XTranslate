Scene 1
r:"^啊，(.*)！\n早啊！$"="Ah, $1!\nMorning!"

你看今天早上的新闻了吗？=Did you see this morning's news?

没看=Didn't see it
自助餐特辑？=Buffet Special?
发生什么了？=What happened?

不是啦！不是这种轻松的新闻！\n你快看看这个！=No! Not that kind of lighthearted news!\nHurry up and take a look at this!
明石他……\n被无差别杀人犯刺杀了……=Akashi, he...\nwas stabbed by a random killer...
你看这个新闻！\n明石他……=Look at this news!\nAkashi, he...
被无差别杀人犯刺杀了……！=was stabbed by a random killer...!

你看，死者是东京都内的教育顾问，\n明石京先生……=Look, the victim is an education consultant in Tokyo, Kei Akashi-san...
「嫌疑人被当场逮捕」……="The suspect was arrested on the spot"...
「正在调查其与明石的关系」……="Currently investigating their relationship with Akashi"...
早，各位\n大家看到明石的新闻了吗？=Morning, everyone.\nDid you all see the news about Akashi?
r:"^看到了！\n正在跟(.*)聊这事呢 $"="Saw it!\nI was just talking to $1 about it."

正准备给你们发信息\n我到了教室后才听说的=I was just about to message you guys—\nonly heard about it after I got to the classroom.
班里所有人都在聊这事=Everyone in class is talking about it.
我们班也是=Same in our class.
因为明石和我有过节……\n一直被他们缠着问来问去=Since Akashi and I had a falling out...\nthey've been swarming me with questions.
总之\n中午咱们天台集合吧？=Anyway,\nlet's meet on the rooftop at lunch, yeah?
好啊\n打字也不方便\n老师差不多要来了=Sure.\nTyping’s a hassle too,\nand the teacher’s about to show up.
知道了=Got it
中午再说=Talk more at lunch
好，中午见=Cool, see you at lunch.

Scene 2

网上说，\n刺杀明石的似乎也是魅影。=Online rumors say\nthe one who stabbed Akashi might also be a Phantom.
听说凶手在车站附近到处晃，\n边自言自语边乱挥剪刀，还突然怪叫……=Apparently the culprit was wandering near the station,\nmumbling to himself, swinging scissors around, and suddenly screaming...
好像被投稿过好几次了。\n大家都叫他「涩谷剪刀男」。=Seems like he was posted about several times.\nEveryone’s calling him the “Shibuya Scissor Man”.
网上现在有两种意见：\n「和明石无关的魅影无差别杀人」……=Right now there are two opinions online:\n“a Phantom randomly killing people unrelated to Akashi”...
和「对明石怀恨在心的人行凶」。\n大家在评论区里讨论得热火朝天呢。=and “someone who held a grudge against Akashi committed the crime”.\nThe comment sections are going wild.
因为有人死了，\n所以就上了热搜吗……=So it only made the trending list\nbecause someone died...
虽说这是人性，但对让明石改心的吾等而言，\n心情还是很复杂呐……=I know that’s just human nature, but for us—who made Akashi have a change of heart—\nit’s still a complicated feeling...
……明石是在警察局前被刺的吧。=...Akashi was stabbed in front of the police station, right?
难不成他……\n那时是想去自首吗？=Could it be... he was planning to turn himself in?

我也这么觉得=I think so too
不清楚=Not sure

是吧……毕竟他在磨我痛神的视频里，\n也说什么要赎罪之类的呢。=Right... after all, in that Magatsushin video,\nhe did talk about wanting to atone and all that.
嗯，也许只是凑巧路过那里。\n只是……=Yeah, maybe he just happened to be passing by there.\nIt's just that...
毕竟他在磨我痛神的视频里，\n也说过什么要赎罪之类的呢。=After all, in that Magatsushin video,\nhe did talk about wanting to atone and all that.
我觉得，\n可能他是真要去自首……=I think...\nmaybe he really was going to turn himself in...

但是竟然……\n就这么死掉了……=But still...\nto think he just died like that...
大家觉不觉得这件事未免也太巧了？=Don’t you all think this whole thing is a little too convenient?
欸？=Huh?
在警察局附近「刚好」有杀人犯，\n明石「刚好」经过那里所以被杀。=A murderer just happens to be near the police station,\nand Akashi just happens to pass by and gets killed.
这真的只是偶然吗？=Is that really just a coincidence?
什么意思？=What do you mean?
如果正是因为他要去自首，\n所以才惨遭「灭口」呢……？=What if it was because he was going to turn himself in...\nthat he was silenced…?
被灭口……！=Silenced…!

被「幕后推手」？=By that person?
被「那个人」？=By the mastermind?
被谁？=By who?

没错。\n宫泽和明石都提到过的……「那个人」。=That’s right. The one both Miyazawa and Akashi mentioned... “That person”.
扭曲了他们的欲望，\n让他们创造出宫殿的，「幕后推手」。=The one who distorted their desires, and led them to create Palaces—the “mastermind behind the scenes”.
没错。就是操纵明石他们的欲望，\n让他们创造出宫殿的「幕后推手」。=Exactly. The one behind the scenes who manipulates people’s desires and causes them to create Palaces.
也是改心后的宫泽和明石所说的……\n「那个人」。=The same 'person' that both the reformed Miyazawa and Akashi mentioned...
明石受他指使潜入学校，\n故意把片山老师塑造成魅影。=Akashi was acting on their orders when he infiltrated the school and made Katayama-sensei out to be a Phantom.
你不记得了吗？\n宫泽和明石的阴影提到过的「那个人」。=Don’t you remember? The “person” mentioned by the Shadows of Miyazawa and Akashi.
扭曲了魅影们的欲望，\n制造出宫殿的「幕后推手」啊。=The “mastermind behind the scenes” who distorted the Phantoms’ desires and created the Palaces.

没错，\n是为了查我们{{A}}的身份吧。=Right, that was to figure out our Phantom Thieves' identities, wasn’t it?
但反而明石却被我们……\n被{{A}}改心了。=But instead, Akashi was… reformed by us, by the Phantom Thieves.
考虑到明石在失控前的言行，\n可能他从那时起就已经被抛弃了……=Considering how he acted before he lost control, maybe he had already been abandoned by that person back then…
不管怎样，他那段自白视频，\n一定也引起了幕后推手的注意。=Either way, his confession video must have drawn the mastermind’s attention.
然后那个人发现明石已经被改心，\n为了不暴露身份就下手灭口……吧。=Then that person realized Akashi had been reformed, and silenced him to avoid being exposed… right.
这……=That’s...
这么说，杀害明石的那个魅影，\n也是幕后推手的手下吗……？=So you’re saying the Phantom who killed Akashi was also working under the mastermind…?
可是，就算是买凶杀人，\n也不可能直接在警察局门口动手吧！=But even if it was, doing it right in front of a police station is insane!
的确如此……=True...
不过，\n也许那个人真的具备如此强大的影响力呢。=But maybe that person really does have that much power and influence.
啊，要是被他知道了{{A}}的身份，\n我们也会被……？=Ah, if he finds out who we Phantom Thieves really are, we’ll also be...?
唔……=Ngh…
虽然还不知道幕后推手的真实身份，\n毫无疑问，他是个可怕的敌人。=We still don’t know the true identity of the mastermind, but without a doubt, he’s a terrifying enemy.
今后吾等必须更加谨慎行事。=From now on, we must act even more carefully.
不过……有这么危险的人到处干坏事，\n反而更需要我们{{A}}出手吧。=Still... with someone this dangerous out there causing trouble, that just makes it even more important for us Phantom Thieves to act.
不如我们继续攻略其他宫殿，\n把他逼出来！=Why don’t we keep taking down more Palaces and force him out!
说得也是。\n怪盗被坏人吓倒，这不是搞反了嘛！=True! If the Phantom Thieves get scared off by bad people, that’d be totally backwards!
当然，吾也并不打算停止攻略宫殿。\n但大家一定要加倍小心，没问题吧？=Naturally, I have no intention of stopping our Palace heists either. But everyone must be twice as cautious, understood?
现在已经拿到了四个秘宝……\n还是想尽快找到下一座宫殿……=We’ve already secured four Treasures... I really want to find the next Palace soon...
啊……=Ah...
嗯？\n怎么了，学姐。=Hm?\nWhat’s up, senpai?
那个……最近几天，\n我可能都没办法在放学后参加行动了。=Well... for the next few days,\nI probably won’t be able to join after-school missions.

{{A}}不在怎么行！=We can’t do this without you!


真的很抱歉。\n可是……=I'm really sorry.\nBut...
……已刮学园的「学园祭」，\n不是马上就要到了吗？=...Kokatsu Academy “School Festival” is coming up soon, right?
今年好像会特别忙。\n所以放学后我应该腾不出时间来……=Sounds like it’s going to be especially hectic this year.\nSo I probably won’t have time after class...
学园祭啊……好像的确到时候了。\n但风纪委员也会很忙吗？=The school festival, huh... guess it is that time.\nBut even the Discipline Committee gets busy?
当然。无论是准备期还是活动当天，\n杂事都比平时多了不少。=Of course. There are way more tasks than usual,\nboth during prep and on the day itself.
而且……\n这次还不止是这个原因呢……=And...\n that’s not the only reason this time...

啊，找到了……！\n{{A}}，救命啊！=Ah, there you are...! Tanemura-senpai, help us!
……怎么了？=...What’s going on?
学园祭的交流活动……\n己刮和轨雅高中要合演舞台剧！？=A joint performance for the school festival...?\nKokatsu and Higa High are co-producing a stage play!?
可是，\n我们学校根本没有戏剧部啊！=But...\nour school doesn’t even have a drama club!
就是说啊！但这是之前……\n月见里老师和明石老师擅自定的！=Exactly! But this was something...\nYamanashi-sensei and Akashi-sensei decided on their own!
说什么，轨雅有学生是专业的舞台演员，\n还有职业漫画家……=They said Higa has a student who’s a professional stage actor,\nand even a published manga artist...
老师他们好像是想靠那两个学生，\n给学园祭拉观众呢！=They were probably hoping to draw in a crowd by relying on those two students!
所以就说要合演舞台剧对吧。\n该说他们欠考虑呢，还是目光短浅呢……=So that’s why they suggested a joint stage play, huh.\nCan’t tell if they were being thoughtless or just short-sighted...
然后呢？现在两位老师都不在了，\n才发现有这件事？=And now? You’re only realizing this\nafter both teachers are gone?
对啊！而且轨雅的戏剧部好像还很上心，\n咱们怎么办才好啊……！=Yeah! And apparently Higa’s drama club is really into it—\nwhat are we supposed to do...?!
然后……{{A}}，\n你不会说了「我来想想办法」之类的话吧？=So then... Riko-senpai, don’t tell me you said\nsomething like “I’ll figure something out”?
说了……=I did say that...
因为他们看上去很惨啊。\n本来这个时候最忙的就是执行委员。=They just looked so pitiful, you know? And this is supposed to be the busiest time for the committee members.
而且我一听说是那两个人留下的烂摊子，\n就更不能置之不理了。=Plus, once I heard it was a mess left behind by those two, I couldn’t just ignore it.
哎～=Geez～

{{A}}太好心了=Riko, you’re too kind
你又在勉强自己了=You’re pushing yourself again

对啊……我们只是担心，\n学姐又要操心这操心那了……=I know... You’re just worried I’ll end up running around\ntrying to handle everything again, right?
这倒是不会。毕竞明石所渭的工作改革已经废除了……=That won't happen again.\nAfter all, Akashi’s so-called “work reform” has already been scrapped...
这倒是不会。\n毕竟明石所谓的工作改革已经废除了……=Thanks, but I’m okay. After all, Akashi’s so-called “work reform” has already been scrapped...


片山老师也恢复了工作，\n她会牵头让其他老师帮我的。=And Katayama-sensei is back to work now. She’s taking the lead and getting other teachers to help me.
要是{{A}}能忙得过来倒也没什么。\n那个教务主任还真是丢下个烂摊子啊……=Well, if you can manage, then that’s fine.\nThat guidance director really left one heck of a mess behind, huh...
月见里是已经向警察自首，\n现在被停职处分了吧？=Yamanashi already turned himself in to the police,\nand he’s been suspended, right?
是的，到现在也没确定返校日期。\n感觉他更有可能会被直接辞退吧。=Yes, and there’s still no set date for his return.\nHonestly, it seems more likely he’ll just be dismissed entirely.
我暂且从月见里老师的电脑里，\n确认了这次活动的策划案……=For now, I checked the project proposal\non Yamanashi-sensei’s computer...
原计划是以风纪委员为主力，\n让各个委员会的学生都参与演出。=The original plan was to have the Discipline Committee as the main cast,\nwith students from various other committees participating too.
打算赶鸭子上架演戏啊……\n这也太随便了……=Forcing people to act out of nowhere...\nthat’s way too half-baked...
而且说什么以风纪委员为主力，\n显然是打算都扔给{{A}}啊……=And saying the Discipline Committee would take the lead\njust means he was planning to dump it all on Riko-senpai...
那要按照月见里的安排，\n让风纪委员去演戏吗？=So are we actually supposed to follow Yamanashi-sensei’s plan\nand have the Discipline Committee act?
那是真不行啦。\n而且其他委员在活动期间也都很忙的。=That’s just not going to work.\nAnd the other committee members are all super busy during the event too.
那怎么办啊？=Then what do we do?

道个歉拒绝？=Apologize and decline?
招募其他有志之士？=Recruit willing volunteers?
不会让我们上吧……？=...You’re not gonna make us perform, right?

说实话，\n这才是正确的选择……=Honestly,\nthat would be the right thing to do...
但我想先试着招募一下有志之士呢。=But I’d like to try recruiting some willing volunteers first.
呵呵，不愧是队长。\n其实我也是这么想的。=Hehe, that’s our leader for you.\nActually, I was thinking the same thing.
呵呵，其实我也想过这样，\n不过我打算先招募一下有志之士。=Hehe, actually I thought about that too,\n but I’m planning to recruit some like-minded people first.

尽管我也考虑过跟轨雅道歉，\n婉拒这次交流活动,但……=I did consider apologizing to Higa\nand turning down the joint performance, but...
虽说这是月见里老师擅自定的，\n可对轨雅来说也是学校间的约定啊。=Even if it was something Yamanashi-sensei decided on his own,\nfrom Higa’s perspective, it’s still a promise between schools.
在对方戏剧部看来，\n他们会觉得已刮的学生说话不算话。=From their drama club’s point of view,\nthey’ll probably feel like Kokatsu’s students can’t keep their word.
的确……会被抱怨说：\n「明明是己刮来求我们的，搞什么啊！」=That's true... People might complain:\n“You were the one who came begging us for help, what the heck?”
对。所以我觉得，\n比起直接放弃，不如先努力一下试试看。=Yeah. That’s why I think instead of giving up right away,\nwe should at least try our best first.
你已经有了很不错的欲望，{{A}}。\n吾相信你的想法会感染学生们的。=You already have a very good desire, Riko.\nI believe your mindset will inspire the students.
谢谢。不过……\n能不能招到人，我心里也没底呢……=Thanks. But...\nI'm still not sure if we’ll actually be able to recruit anyone...
我会问问班里的同学！\n对了，是不是做个海报效果更好？=I’ll ask around in class!\nOh, and maybe making a poster would help too?
我也来帮忙，如果有需要的地方就说。\n虽然我对演戏完全是门外汉……=I’ll help out too. Just let me know if there’s anything I can do.\nThough I know nothing about acting at all...

我也会帮忙的=I'll help too.
我会为你加油的=I’ll be cheering for you

谢谢大家。=Thanks, everyone.
不是啦，别光顾着加油，\nWonder也来帮忙啊……=No, that’s not it—don’t just cheer us on,\nWonder, you should help out too...
呵呵，谢谢。这毕竟是我揽下的事，\n只是加油我也会很开心的。=Hehe, thanks. This is something I took on myself,\nso even just cheering me on makes me happy.

好了，差不多下午的课也要开始了。\n咱们回教室吧？=Alright, it’s about time for the afternoon classes to start.\nLet’s head back to the classroom, shall we?

好了，Wonder！\n咱们出发吧～！=Alright, Wonder! Let’s head out～!
去哪儿？=Where to?
那摞纸是……=The stack of papers is ......

当然是发传单啦！\n帮理子学姐招募演舞台剧的演员呀！=We’re handing out flyers, of course! To help Riko-senpai find actors for the stage play!
都是传单哦！\n帮{{A}}招募演舞台剧演员的！=They’re flyers! We’re helping Riko-senpai recruit actors for the stage play!
嚯……！？\n你都已经做好了吗！=Whoa...!?\nYou already got them all ready!?
那是。同伴碰到困难，哪能放着不管哇。\n俗话说「好事宜迟」嘛！=Of course! When a teammate’s in trouble, we can’t just sit around and do nothing.\nLike the saying goes, “Good things should be late!”
……是「好事不宜迟」啦。=...It’s “Good things shouldn’t be delayed”.
哦，是吗？哎呀别在意那些细节！\n咱们开始发传单吧～Let's go！=Oh, really? Eh, don’t sweat the details!\nLet’s start passing out these flyers—Let’s go!

派发传单=Hand out flyers

我们是学园祭戏剧组～\n正在招募有志人士～！=We are the School Festival Drama Group ～We are recruiting aspiring people～!
无论是否对表演感兴趣，\n希望大家都能踊跃参加～！=Whether interested in performing or not, we hope that everyone will attend ~!
和{{A}}一起发了传单……=Flyer with {{A}} ......

在天台集合=Gather on the rooftop
完全招不到人啊……=Can't recruit at all ......
可不是嘛。就算趁放学后发传单，\n也没人停下来听我们说话……=No one stops to listen to us even when we hand out flyers after school ......
啊，我也是。\n在班里拉了一圈人，全灭……=Ah, me too.\nPulled a circle of people in the class and all but wiped out ......
有的说社团活动太忙了，\n也有很多根本就没想去学园祭。=Some say they are too busy with club activities, and many don't want to go to the school festival at all.
欸，还有人不参加吗！？=Hey, is there anyone else who won't participate!
好不容易不上课，要回家睡觉。\n好几个人都这么说呢。=It's so hard to stay out of class and go home to sleep. several people have said that.
怎么会……明明我都已经开始期待，\n学园祭上能吃什么好的了！=How can ...... obviously I'm already looking forward to what good food I can eat at the school festival!
……也就是说，\n有那么多学生失去了欲望啊。=...... That means so many students have lost their desire ah.

的确……\n感觉比起去年，学园祭的热度降低了不少。=That’s true...\nCompared to last year, the excitement around the school festival feels way lower.
所以才招不到演出的人吗……=Maybe that’s why we can’t recruit anyone for the performance...
当然，\n还有很多是不好意思上台啦～=Well, yeah,\nand a lot of people are just too shy to get on stage～
他们说如果「{{A}}」要来的话，\n就想去看看。但绝对不想自己上台演。=They say if {{A}} is coming, they’d love to go watch. But absolutely no way they’d perform themselves.

{{A}}？={{A}}？
是哪个明星吗？=Is that some kind of celebrity?

欸，你忘了?本来这次，\n就是想靠轨雅的专业演员拉客呢。=Eh, did you forget?\nThe whole point this time was to draw a crowd using Higa’s professional actor.
那个演员就是池波星辉。\n好像是高三学生。=That actor is Shoki Ikenami.\nI think he’s a third-year student.
没错，是在轨雅上学的专业演员啦。\n听说是高三学生呢。=That’s right, he’s a professional actor who goes to Higa. I heard he’s a third-year student.

CHI BO XING HUI……\n我没听说过啊。=Shoki Ikenami...I’ve never heard of him.
他似乎没怎么上过电视，\n是以演舞台剧为主的。=Seems like he hasn’t really been on TV,\nhe mainly performs in stage plays.
我之前也不了解，搜了一下才知道，\n他好像在初高中生之间很受欢迎呢。=I didn’t know about him either until I looked him up—\napparently he’s pretty popular among middle and high school students.
可不是吗～\n我们班也有不少他的粉丝。=Totally～\nthere are quite a few fans of his in our class too.
说他的彩排视频和幕后花絮都超帅，\n安利我看了好多呢。=They kept recommending me his rehearsal videos and behind-the-scenes clips,\nsaying he looks super cool in them.

什么啊，那让他的那些粉丝们，\n来演这个舞台剧不就好了嘛。=What? Then why not have his fans be the ones to act in the play?
不是哦，她们说去看自己的推当然很好，\n但要跟推站在同一个舞台上就不行。=Nope, they said watching their fave is great and all,\nbut standing on the same stage as him is a totally different story.
啊？要是让我跟老爹在同一个厨房做拉面，\n那可是再开心不过了！=Huh? If I got to make ramen with my old man in the same kitchen, I’d be over the moon!
拉面跟演戏是不一样的吧……\n原来对{{A}}来说，山越叔叔是「推」啊……=Ramen and acting aren’t the same thing... So to you, Yamagoshi-san is your “fave”, huh, {{A}}...
唉……\n跟轨雅碰面的日子快到了，真伤脑筋啊。=Sigh...\nThe day we meet with Higa is coming up fast. This is such a headache. 

如果再招不到人的话……\n{{A}}，能麻烦你来演吗？=If we really can’t recruit anyone... {{A}}, could I ask you to take the role？
欸欸？\n真的要让我演吗！？=Eh, eh！？\nYou seriously want me to act！？

很合适啊=Sounds like a great fit
我一定会去捧场的=I’ll totally come cheer you on
有点担心……=Kinda worried though...

嗯，论演技的话{{A}}肯定没问题，\n毕竟连明石也能骗过。=Yeah, when it comes to acting, {{A}} would totally be fine—after all, she even managed to fool Akashi.
呜呜～可是，\n在舞台上演戏是另一回事吧！？=Uuugh～ But\nperforming on stage is totally different, isn't it！？
等等等等，\n咱能不能別站着说话不腰疼？=W-wait, wait, wait—\neasy for you to say when you’re not the one on stage！
对吧对吧！？\n我肯定不行的啦，学姐！=See？ See？ I told you I can't do it, senpai！
不，我觉得素羽你很合适啊。\n骗明石那时候，你的演技可精湛了。=No way, Motoha—you're perfect for this！ Remember when we fooled Akashi？ Your acting was flawless.
不，可是，\n我当时好多话都是真心话来着……=But...\na lot of what I said back then... wasn't really acting...

{{A}}……拜托你了！={{A}}... I'm begging you！
呜哇，被{{A}}这么一求，\n让我怎么忍心拒绝……！=Ugh, when you ask me like that, {{A}}...\nhow can I possibly say no...？！
呃，那行吧……\n如果完全招不到人的话……我就上？=Well... fine then...\nIf we absolutely can't find anyone else... I'll do it？
谢谢你，{{A}}！=Thank you, {{A}}！
唉，一定要招到人啊……！=Sigh... You'd better find someone else...！

Scene 3 

呐，刚才朋友发信息说，\n{{A}}现在就在我们学校哦！=Hey, my friend just messaged me—\n{{A}} is at our school right now！
真假！？什么情况！？他在哪儿！？=For real！？ What’s going on！？ Where is he！？
我也不知道啦！你看，还有照片！\n他在己刮的走廊上呢！=I don’t know either！ Look, there’s even a photo！\nHe’s in the hallway by Kokatsu building.
欸，真的！\n咱们走！快去找找他！=Whoa, seriously！\nLet’s go！ We gotta find him！
Wonder，咱们走吧！\n听说集合地点是<color\=#ff0000>接待室</color>。=Wonder, let’s go.\nI heard the meeting spot is the <color\=#ff0000>reception room</color>.
你忘啦？\n就是跟轨雅戏剧部的第一次碰头啦。=Did you forget？\nIt’s our first meeting with Higa High's Drama Club.
我们虽然只是帮忙的，\n但{{A}}说让我们也一起。走吧？=We’re just helping out,\nbut {{A}} said we should join too. Let’s go？ 

Scene 4

{{A}}！={{A}}！
啊，是{{A}}，还有Wonder。\n谢谢你们能来。=Ah, it's {{A}} and Wonder.\nThanks for coming.
招人的事情……\n最后怎么样了？=About the recruitment...\nhow did it go in the end？
很遗憾，目前依然是0人。\n看来{{A}}和我参演，已经板上钉钉了……=Unfortunately, still zero people.\nLooks like it's set in stone that just you and I will be performing, {{A}}...
唉……=Sigh...
真的吗……也就是说，\n己刮这边只有学姐跟{{A}}出场吗？=Really...？ So that means, from Kokatsu's side, only you and {{A}} are appearing？
是啊。结果就我们俩参加，\n还是会让轨雅对我们印象很差吧。=Yep. With just the two of us participating,\nI’m afraid it’ll leave a really bad impression on Higa High.
如今只能告诉他们这边的真实情况，\n好好道歉了。=At this point, we’ll just have to explain the situation honestly\nand apologize properly.
如果对方不想合作，这件事就到此为止。\n如果还愿意继续合演的话……=If they’re not up for collaborating, then that’ll be the end of it.\nBut if they’re still willing to co-perform...
那咱们就加油吧，{{A}}。=Then let’s give it our all, {{A}}.
呜啊啊……=Uwahhh...
